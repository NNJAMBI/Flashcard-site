                    <h2><strong>Javascript</strong></h2>
                    <p1>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features
                        on web pages <br>
                        every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to
                        look at <br>
                        displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video
                        jukeboxes, etc. <br>
                        you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. <br>
                        It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and
                        CSS) </p1>

                    <h3><strong>jQuery</strong></h3>

                    <p2>jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. <br>
                        It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, <br>
                        and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. <br>
                        With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of
                        people write JavaScript</p2>

                    <h4><strong>Chaining methods</strong></h4>
                    <p3>Chaining allows us to run multiple jQuery methods (on the same element) within a single statement. </p3>

                    <h5><strong>Boolean</strong></h5>

                    <p4>Booleans represent one of two values: True or False . Boolean Values. In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False</p4>
